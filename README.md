# springdatajpa-manytomany
On how to implement relations many-to-many between entities in Spring, using Spring Data JPA. 

In Spring, with Spring Data JPA, a many-to-many relationship between two entities can be implemented in several ways. Here we describe some of them:

1. Default JPA Implementation, using Join Table:
   The most straightforward approach where JPA automatically creates a join table. See example in the directory default-jpa.
   Characteristics:
   - Uses @ManyToMany annotation
   - Join table is automatically managed by JPA
   - One side is owner (Student) with @JoinTable, other side uses mappedBy

2. Explicit Join Table:
   The jointable is modeled using an entity. See example in the directory explicit-join-table.
   Advantages:
   - Gives full control over the join table.
   - Ability to add additional fields to the relationship.
   - More flexible queries.
   - Better performance for certain operations.
  
3. Using Composite Primary Key in Join Entity: 
   A more sophisticated version of the explicit join entity approach.
   Benefits:
   - More natural primary key representation
   - Better performance for some queries
   - Cleaner database schema
  
Additional Configuration Options:
- Lazy vs Eager Loading
  
// Default is LAZY
@ManyToMany(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)

// Or EAGER (not recommended for collections)
@ManyToMany(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)

 Generally use LAZY loading for collections to avoid N+1 query problems.

- Cascade Options
@ManyToMany(cascade = {
    CascadeType.PERSIST,
    CascadeType.MERGE
})

Common cascade types:
    PERSIST: Save operations cascade
    MERGE: Update operations cascade
    REMOVE: Delete operations cascade (use with caution in many-to-many)
    ALL: All operations cascade

- Orphan Removal
  @ManyToMany(orphanRemoval = true)

  Removes child entities when they're removed from the collection.

# Best Practices and Considerations
    1. Owner Side: Always clearly define which side is the owner of the relationship (where you put @JoinTable).
    2. Bidirectional vs Unidirectional:
        Bidirectional: Both entities reference each other (as in examples above)
        Unidirectional: Only one entity references the other (simpler but less flexible)
    3. Collection Types:
        Use Set to avoid duplicates (recommended)
        List can be used if ordering is important (with @OrderColumn)
    4. Performance Considerations:
        Large collections can cause performance issues
        Consider pagination or custom queries for large datasets
    5. Equals and HashCode:
        Implement properly to avoid issues in collections
        Avoid using entity IDs in equals/hashCode before persistence



# When to Choose Which Approach

1. Simple @ManyToMany:
    When you don't need additional fields in the relationship
    Quick prototyping
    Simple read-only relationships
2. Explicit Join Entity:
    When you need additional attributes in the relationship
    When you need more control over the join table
    For complex querying requirements
    When you anticipate the relationship might evolve
3. Composite Key Join Entity:
    When you want to enforce the relationship as the primary key
    For more natural database representation
    When you frequently query by both parent entities together
